                        “Luminous Wizards" is the project created in 2016 by professional dancers, who have partnered
                        together
                        for the past 6 years. The project is based on the mixing of different dance styles (Hip-hop,
                        Popping,
                        House, Breaking, Locking) with acrobatic elements. The main "highlight" of our project - using in
                        performances LED suits, which allow us to create unusual effects, thus focusing the viewer's
                        attention
                        on the show. In addition, the use of these costumes provides opportunities for mobile changes of the
                        program, which is important for long-term contracts or force major circumstances .
                    </p>
                    <p>Our team consists of eight people (7 dancers and a technician-engineer). Choreography, selection of
                        music, software and maintenance of the show is produced by the project participants themselves,
                        which
                        makes our team fully autonomous.
                    </p>
                    <p> Despite the youth of this project, each participant of the show already has enough experience on the
                        stage as in the self-presentations, and team projects.
                        In addition, given our experience in this project, we can confidently assert that its format allows
                        us
                        to integrate into a show of any kind for performances at different venues – in vaudeville, night
                        clubs,
                        theatres, cruise liners etc. the Only prerequisite is the ability to completely turn off lighting on
                        stage.
                    </p>
                    <p> The team knows their job, knows how to work on stage and most importantly loves it, be treated with
                        respect to the audience and his colleagues.
